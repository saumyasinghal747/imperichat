Chances are you have lots of friends,
 but maybe they're not in every single one  of your classes.
 
For example, I don't know anyone in my English class. If I have a question about an assignment, I don't know who I would ask.
I'm sure you can think of at least one class you have like this.
 
 The purpose of this 
app is to connect you with people who are in your classes by creating a group chat for every class. 

You'll also be able to
speak with references to  any assignments in that class. 

 Most importantly, you'll get to
 know your classmates. 
 
Later, you will also be able to flag an assignment as "help me" or "ask me if you need help"
so other classmates know who they can help or ask for help.
